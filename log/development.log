Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness may also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as a lump sum. Other expenses (such as funeral expenses) are also sometimes included in the benefits.</p><p>Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot and civil commotion.</p><p>There is a difference between the insured and the policy owner, although the owner and the insured are often the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and he will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it. Also, most companies allow the payer and owner to be different, e. g. a grandparent paying premiums for a policy on a child, owned by a grandchild.</p>"], ["category", "life_insurance"], ["created_at", Mon, 30 Dec 2013 17:44:40 UTC +00:00], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["promo_content_type", nil], ["promo_file_name", nil], ["promo_file_size", nil], ["promo_updated_at", nil], ["tags", "life insurance,retirement,money,premiums,costs"], ["title", "Life Insurance Premiums"], ["updated_at", Mon, 30 Dec 2013 17:44:40 UTC +00:00], ["user_id", 1], ["visible", true]]

Previously, low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement, in 1889.[4]</p><p>Nowadays most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, which may be sponsored by employers and/or the state. In many poorer countries, support for the old is still mainly provided through the family. Today, retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies, and hard ideological, social, cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right. In many western countries this right is mentioned in national constitutions.</p><p>Recent advances in data collection have vastly improved our ability to understand important relationships between retirement and factors such as health, wealth, employment characteristics and family dynamics, among others. The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing Health and Retirement Study (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains a wealth of information on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), financial variables (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) and a host of other topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, time use).</p>"], ["category", "financial_planning"], ["created_at", Mon, 30 Dec 2013 17:44:40 UTC +00:00], ["image_content_type", nil], ["image_file_name", nil], ["image_file_size", nil], ["image_updated_at", nil], ["promo_content_type", nil], ["promo_file_name", nil], ["promo_file_size", nil], ["promo_updated_at", nil], ["tags", "financial planning,finances,money,insurance,retirement,nest egg"], ["title", "Building Your Nest Egg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 30 Dec 2013 17:44:40 UTC +00:00], ["user_id", 2], ["visible", true]]
